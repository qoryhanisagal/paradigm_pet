## ⚫️ Design and Customization

The design is built around a distinct, defined color palette and typography.

| Functional Role       | Hex Code           | Description                                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Brand**     | `#003B6D`          | Main branding color, used for headers, strong text, and navigation.                        |
| **Secondary Brand**   | `#6699CC`          | Used for backgrounds, shadow effects, and secondary brand elements.                        |
| **Main Accent/CTA**   | `#FDB515`          | Bright, high-visibility color for calls-to-action, highlights, and icons.                  |
| **Neutral Dark Text** | `#333` / `#676767` | Used for body text and secondary text.                                                     |
| **Light Neutrals**    | `#BDBDBD`          | Used for light borders, separators, and subtle backgrounds (e.g., "Coming Soon" elements). |

**Key Customization Points:**

- **Styling:** All custom styles are currently located within the `<style>` block in `index.html`. For larger development, it's highly recommended to move this into an external `style.css` file.
- **Color Consistency:** The project now uses the specific color `#BDBDBD` for light elements (like borders and the "Coming Soon" button) and `#676767` for some dark text/neutral elements for brand consistency.
- **Logo/Images:** Update the `img/logo-icon.png` and `img/hero.png` paths with your actual asset files.

---

## ⚫️ Future Improvements

- Implement the full **Bird Care** and **Small Animals** resource pages.
- Develop the backend functionality for the **Quick Consultation Form** to handle form submissions.
- Integrate a live search capability with the **Global Search Modal** instead of a static display.
- Convert the inline `<style>` block into an external `style.css` file for better code separation and maintenance.
